    Represents a patch of land with sensors for monitoring and managing and a relay device for watering the zone.

    This class provides an interface to interact with various sensors and devices associated
    with a specific zone, such as retrieving environmental data (humidity, temperature, pH,
    salinity, etc.), controlling water flow through a relay device, and reading soil nutrients levels
    like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It abstracts the hardware interaction into an
    easy-to-use API for both monitoring and control purposes.
